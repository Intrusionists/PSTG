# PSTG
This Repository is a Practical Web Security Testing Guide.

Since [WSTG](https://github.com/OWASP/wstg) is a known method for Security Testing a Web Application, we try and share our thouhgts and knwoledge based on it's Test Obejctives, Names and Titles.

With respect to [OWASP](https://owasp.org) and everyone who contributed to WSTG Project, Our work needed a different order of Tests, also some Tests seems a lot like each other and had ovelaps (or at least this is our understanding); so the order of Tests may be different from WSTG and also some Tests may be merged together.

>__Note:__ If anyone has a clear understanding of the Tests and thinks we are wrong, their thoughts are much appreciated.

Along the way, we may propose some new Tests that based on our experience, was missing in WSTG. For the time being, we are not going to submit them to OWASP, but when they're mature enough, we may do that as well.

Some may ask "Why reinventing the wheel?", they are right and that's why we are sharing our learnings based on their footsteps. The thing is we think WSTG is not practical enough. it's a good source for learning, but after reading it, one cannot become Pentester. And for some understandable reasons it lacks the latest findings and methods. So we try our best (and need your help doing so) to prepare a Practical Guide `or die trying`.

Be patient as we are preparing...
